# Good README Genertator


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a README generator that generated a README.md file based on the information inputted by the user on the command line.

## Table of Contents

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)

## Installation

To generate your own README, run 'npm install' to install the inquirer and util packages, which are listed as dependencies in the package.json

## Usage 

The user must run 'node index.js' in order to begin running the application. After the user has answered all of the questions, "You have written the file!" will be logged to the console and a new README will be generated.
